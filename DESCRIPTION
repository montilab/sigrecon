Description: Provides metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of signature recontextualizaiton methods based on curated datasets of perturbational signatures: Perturb-Seq, DrugMatrix, and SciPlex. Additionally, provides two baseline methods of signature recontextualization based on network propagation and gene set variation analysis (GSVA).
