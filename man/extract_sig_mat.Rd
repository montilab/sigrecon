\title{Extracts a signature from a (gene x seed) matrix of stationary probability values.
This is the recontextualized signature.
If doing ks.test, you don't need to find the top_n. Just find ks.test(original, recontextualized ranking) before and after.}
\usage{
extract_sig_mat(
  mat,
  bootstraps = NULL,
  sig_bins = NULL,
  percentile = 0.99,
  limit = 30
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{(n_gene, n_seed) matrix of stationary probability values from rwr_mat}

\item{bootstraps}{A (n_gene, n_bins*n_bootstraps) matrix specifying results from bootstrapped random walks.}

\item{sig_bins}{A named list describing the length of each perturbation.}

\item{percentile}{A double between 0,1 indicating the proportion cutoff for bootstrap-based signature derivation.}

\item{limit}{Number of genes to keep in the output, or a vector of lengths. Default is 30.}
}
\value{
A named list of genesets. Each list element is the recontextualized signature for that seed.
