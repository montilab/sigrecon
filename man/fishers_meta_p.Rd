\title{Combine P-values Using Fisher's Method}
\usage{
fishers_meta_p(pvals)
}
\arguments{
\item{pvals}{Numeric vector of p-values to combine. All values must be between
0 and 1 (exclusive of 0). NA values are not allowed.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the combined p-value.
}
\description{
Combines multiple p-values from independent tests into a single meta p-value
using Fisher's method (also known as Fisher's combined probability test).
}
\details{
Fisher's method combines p-values by computing the test statistic:
\deqn{X = -2 \sum_{i=1}^{k} \ln(p_i)}

Under the null hypothesis (all individual null hypotheses are true), X follows
a chi-squared distribution with 2k degrees of freedom, where k is the number
of p-values. This method assumes that the tests are independent.

The combined p-value represents the probability of observing the given set of
p-values (or more extreme) if all null hypotheses are true.

\examples{
# Combine three p-values
fishers_meta_p(c(0.01, 0.03, 0.25))

# Two significant p-values
fishers_meta_p(c(0.001, 0.005))

# Mix of significant and non-significant
fishers_meta_p(c(0.045, 0.23, 0.67))
