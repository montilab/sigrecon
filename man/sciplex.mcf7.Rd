\description{
DEGs between drug (max dose) and control samples in SciPlex MCF7 cell line data.
There are 60 drugs and DEGs are EnsemblIDs.
For each geneset, the \code{up} set represents the top 100 DEGs
and the \code{up_full} represents the full ranked list of genes ranked by logFC*-log10(adj.p.val).
The length of \code{up_full} ranges from 5704 - 7259 based on the perturbation.
