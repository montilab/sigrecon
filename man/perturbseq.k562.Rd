\description{
DEGs between drug (max dose) and control samples in K562 cell line data.
There are 642 CRISPRi knockdowns and DEGs are HGNC symbols.
For each geneset, the \code{up} set represents the top 100 DEGs
and the \code{up_full} represents the full ranked list of 8561 genes ranked by logFC*-log10(adj.p.val).
The single cell dataset these genesets were derived from had 8561 genes.
