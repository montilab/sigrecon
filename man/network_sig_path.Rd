\title{Generate Network Signatures from a Path}
\usage{
network_sig_path(path, seeds, sig = c("corr", "rwr"), p = 0.1, limit = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string specifying the file path to the network object (RDS file).}

\item{seeds}{Either a single unnamed gene "TP53", a named list of genes, or a list of named lists of genes.}

\item{sig}{The signature generation method. Either "corr" for correlation-based or "rwr" for random walk with restart. Default is c("corr", "rwr").}

\item{p}{A numeric value specifying the restart probability for random walk. Default is 0.1.}

\item{limit}{Number of genes to keep in the output, or a vector of lengths. Default is 30.}
}
\value{
A list of network signatures. If the input is a single network, returns a single signature list. If the input is a list of networks, returns a list of signature lists.
}
\description{
This function reads a network object from a file path and generates network signatures based on provided seeds.
